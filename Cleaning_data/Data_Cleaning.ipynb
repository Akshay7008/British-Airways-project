We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them.\",\n          \"BA268 LAX-LHR seat WT+ on the A380. Check in was quick as was security and the Oneworld lounge at TBI is pretty good although very crowded. Boarding pretty quick on a packed flight. I found the crew seating and PTV to be consistent and very good. Flight left more or less on time and landed 30 min early at T5 bags seemed to take ages coming off but a pretty good flight. I don't know what has happened to BA's food offering in WT+ but it has gone down hill recently the 2nd meal wasn't worth serving otherwise good service on a very nice aircraft.\",\n          \"Second time in 10 days on this flight from London Heathrow to Basel. What has happened to the leg room on British Airways? At 1m 80 my knees were against the seat in front. There used to be a good 3/4 inches of leg room. The \\\"food\\\" which BA proudly advertise consists of a very small sandwich. As usual the onboard staff are the saving grace.
